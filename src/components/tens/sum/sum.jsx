                        A design-minded Frontend Developer who blends
            creativity with code to shape digital experiences that feel
            effortless and look exceptional. Armed with a growing
            command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I craft
            interfaces where aesthetics meet performance. I thrive
            on learning what’s next, refining what exists, and
            transforming concepts into immersive, responsive
            experiences. Seeking a role where I can bring fresh
            imagination, meticulous detail, and a modern touch to
            every pixel and interaction
